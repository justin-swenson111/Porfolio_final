## FAQ

#### Do I need all the dependencies

If you are viewing the site via github Pages you dont need it, but if you are running it locally you do need sass to edit the scss and emailjs for the email functionality.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/justin-swenson111/Porfolio_final.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd path\Porfolio_final
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install sass
  npm install --save @emailjs/browser
```

Open the file

```bash
  explorer "C:\Users\justi\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Porfolio_final\index.html"
```
